10. Qf3 {Though check with the Knight is now threatened,
White's intention is not aggresive but merely the protection
of the g-pawn.} c6 11. O-O-O f5 12. Ng3 Nd7 13. Bc4 {But here
White begins to be aggresive and therby he puts himself in the
wrong for his aim is not even remotely warranted by his
advantage. Again he should strive to safeguard his g-pawn by
13.Nh5, to be followed by Rg1, and afterwards possibly by h3
and g4 with some little pressure on the center and on the
h-pawn, proportionate to his advantage in mobility. As he
plays White begins to slide first very slowly; afterwards more
quickly.} Qc7 14. Rhe1 Nf6 15. Qe2 O-O-O {Black has defended
conscientiously. If White now continues 16.Nxf5 Qf4+ 17.Ne3
Rxd4 18.Ba6 he can still obtain equality. But here is the
parting of the ways.} 16. Bxe6+ {White fancies that he holds
an advantage and attempts to win. The punishment is
immediate.} fxe6 17. Qxe6+ Rd7 18. Nxf5 Bd8 19. Ne4 Nxe4
